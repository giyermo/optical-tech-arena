Network input
--------------------------
5 6 -> vertices, edges
1 1 1 1 1 -> channel conversion oportunity for each vertex
1 2 -> connection for edge
2 5 -> connection for edge
1 4 -> connection for edge
4 5 -> connection for edge
1 3 -> connection for edge
3 5 -> connection for edge
2 -> number of optical services
1 5 2 1 20 1 -> service (source, destination, number of edges, wavelength start, wavelength end, value)
1 2 -> service (path)
1 5 2 21 40 1 -> service (source, destination, number of edges, wavelength start, wavelength end, value)
1 2 -> service (path)
--------------------------
Interaction part
--------------------------
3 -> number of scenarios
1 -> failed edge
5 -> another failed edge
-1 -> scenario end and new one starts (from base_network that doesn't have any failed edge)
1 -> failed edge
2 -> another failed edge
-1 -> scenario end
1 3 -> failed edges
-1 -> scenario end
